http1 vs http2 - 
//forming a tcp connection is slow process
http1 - 
// new tcp connection with every request , slow , buffering

http1.1 - 
// persisted tcp connection , introduce caching , low latency , streaming with chunked 
// transfer(Image loads pixel by pixel)
// pipelining - requests are sorted in order they were sent

http2 -
// multiplexing - send multiple requests on same connection because opening new tcp connection is time taking
// compression - compresses headers to reduce overheaad
// server push - send the data to client / don't wait for client's data parsing
// secure by default 
// 

http3 -
// replaces tcp with udp
// lossy data transfer
// experimental

url paramaters and req body capacity - 
// cookies => 4gb & 180 cookies
// url params => 2048 characters or 2KB
// body capacity => max 2GB

SOAP - 

// Simple Object Access Protocol
// SOAP is stateful while REST is stateless
// SOAP is a protocol whereas rest is an architectural pattern
// SOAP needs more bandwidth than rest because XML file is large
// SOAP works with XML only , whereas REST works with XML/JSON/HTML/plainText

web1 web2 and web3

SHA1 SHA256
// SHA1   is 40 digits or 160 bits // used by ssl certificate authorities to sign certificate                                              // less secure
// SHA256 is 64 digits or 256 bits // used in blockchain // more secure
